# Arc-ModelBuilder
Using ModelBuilder to create a drag and drop program to simulate a bomb detonation in Albert Square
a tool that takes a building polygon shapefile and a point file simulating the exlosion location. 
the tool then creates a buffer at a user set distance(the size of the detenation) and merges this
with the building shapefile to show where would be destroyed in the blast
